        """Experimental method for managing queries, keys and values.

        As argued in [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer
        Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html), queries, keys and
        values are somewhat arbitrary intermediate terms when computing with the low rank factored
        matrices W_QK = W_Q @ W_K.T and W_OV = W_V @ W_O, and these matrices are the only thing
        determining head behaviour. But there are many ways to find a low rank factorization to a
        given matrix, and hopefully some of these are more interpretable than others! This method is
        one attempt, which makes all of the matrices have orthogonal rows or columns, W_O into a
        rotation and W_Q and W_K having the nth column in each having the same norm. The formula is
        $W_V = U @ S,W_O=Vh.T,W_Q=U@S.sqrt(),W_K=Vh@S.sqrt()$.

        More details:

        If W_OV = U @ S @ Vh.T in its singular value decomposition, (where S is in R^d_head not
        R^d_model, as W_OV is low rank), W_OV = (U @ S) @ (Vh.T) is an equivalent low rank
        factorisation, where rows/columns of each matrix are orthogonal! So setting $W_V=US$ and
        $W_O=Vh.T$ works just as well. I *think* this is a more interpretable setup, because now
        $W_O$ is just a rotation, and doesn't change the norm, so $z$ has the same norm as the
        result of the head.

        For $W_QK = W_Q @ W_K.T$ we use the refactor $W_Q = U @ S.sqrt()$ and $W_K = Vh @ S.sqrt()$,
        which is also equivalent ($S==S.sqrt() @ S.sqrt()$ as $S$ is diagonal). Here we keep the
        matrices as having the same norm, since there's not an obvious asymmetry between the keys
        and queries.

        Biases are more fiddly to deal with. For OV it's pretty easy - we just need (x @ W_V + b_V)
        @ W_O + b_O to be preserved, so we can set b_V' = 0. and b_O' = b_V @ W_O + b_O (note that
        b_V in R^{head_index x d_head} while b_O in R^{d_model}, so we need to sum b_V @ W_O along
        the head_index dimension too).

        For QK it's messy - we need to preserve the bilinear form of (x @ W_Q + b_Q) * (y @ W_K +
        b_K), which is fairly messy. To deal with the biases, we concatenate them to W_Q and W_K to
        simulate a d_model+1 dimensional input (whose final coordinate is always 1), do the SVD
        factorization on this effective matrix, then separate out into final weights and biases.
